# Plotly_Bacteria
## Overview Analysis:
Completed an interactive wehsite by helping visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. The goal was to display the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. If Improbable Species identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers involved in this study will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
